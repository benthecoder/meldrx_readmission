The patient was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer and underwent a treatment regimen consisting of chemotherapy followed by a subtotal gastrectomy. Postoperative recovery was initially uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged after a 14-day stay. However, 10 days following discharge, the patient was readmitted with symptoms of abdominal pain and fever. Upon examination, it was determined that the patient had developed a postoperative infection at the surgical site. The infection was managed with antibiotics, and the patient showed significant improvement. After a 7-day stay for the infection treatment, the patient was discharged again with instructions for continued care at home and scheduled for follow-up visits.
